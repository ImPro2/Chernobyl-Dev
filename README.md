Chernobyl-Dev
This is my personal game engine, not following any tutorials. My other repository, Chernobyl, is following TheCherno's Game Engine series (link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxIZbV_XjAs&list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT&index=1)
This is where I put my own knowledge into writing my own game engine, a release will be available in about two years.
